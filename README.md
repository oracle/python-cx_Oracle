# Python cx_Oracle

# News

**cx_Oracle has a major new release under a new name and homepage
[python-oracledb](https://oracle.github.io/python-oracledb/).**

**The source code has moved to
[github.com/oracle/python-oracledb](https://github.com/oracle/python-oracledb).**

New projects should install python-oracledb instead of cx_Oracle.  Critical
patches and binary packages for new Python releases may continue to be made in
the cx_Oracle namespace for a limited time, subject to demand.

# About

cx_Oracle is a Python extension module that enables access to Oracle
Database.  It conforms to the [Python database API 2.0
specification][1] with a considerable number of additions and a couple
of exclusions.  See the
[homepage](https://oracle.github.io/python-cx_Oracle/index.html) for a
feature list.

cx_Oracle 8.3 was tested with Python versions 3.6 through 3.10. You can
use cx_Oracle with Oracle 11.2, 12c, 18c, 19c and 21c client libraries.
Oracle's standard client-server version interoperability allows connection to
both older and newer databases. For example Oracle 19c client libraries can
connect to Oracle Database 11.2.   Older versions of cx_Oracle may work with
older versions of Python.
