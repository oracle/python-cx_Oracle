# cx_Oracle version 8.3 (Development)

cx_Oracle is a Python extension module that enables access to Oracle
Database.  It conforms to the [Python database API 2.0
specification][1] with a considerable number of additions and a couple
of exclusions.  See the
[homepage](https://oracle.github.io/python-cx_Oracle/index.html) for a
feature list.

cx_Oracle 8.3 has been tested with Python versions 3.6 through 3.9. You can use
cx_Oracle with Oracle 11.2, 12c, 18c, 19c and 21c client libraries. Oracle's
standard client-server version interoperability allows connection to both older
and newer databases. For example Oracle 19c client libraries can connect to
Oracle Database 11.2.   Older versions of cx_Oracle may work with older
versions of Python.
