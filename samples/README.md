# Samples

**cx_Oracle has a major new release under a new name and homepage
[python-oracledb](https://oracle.github.io/python-oracledb/). New projects
should use python-oracledb instead of the obsolete cx_Oracle driver.**

Python-oracledb uses the same Python Database API as cx_Oracle, supports the
feature requirements of frameworks that rely on this API, and has many new
features.

**Python-oracledb samples can be found at
[github.com/oracle/python-oracledb/tree/main/samples](https://github.com/oracle/python-oracledb/tree/main/samples).**

To upgrade to python-oracledb, see [Upgrading from cx_Oracle 8.3 to
python-oracledb](https://python-oracledb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/appendix_c.html#upgrading-from-cx-oracle-8-3-to-python-oracledb).
