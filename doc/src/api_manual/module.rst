.. data:: __future__

    Special object which contains attributes which control the behavior of
    cx_Oracle, allowing for opting in for new features. No attributes are
    currently supported so all attributes will silently ignore being set and
    will always appear to have the value None.

    .. note::

        This method is an extension to the DB API definition.

    .. versionadded:: 6.2


.. function:: Binary(string)

    Construct an object holding a binary (long) string value.


.. function:: clientversion()

    Return the version of the client library being used as a 5-tuple. The five
    values are the major version, minor version, update number, patch number
    and port update number.

    .. note::

        This method is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. function:: connect(user=None, password=None, dsn=None, \
        mode=cx_Oracle.DEFAULT_AUTH, handle=0, pool=None, threaded=False, \
        events=False, cclass=None, purity=cx_Oracle.ATTR_PURITY_DEFAULT, \
        newpassword=None, encoding=None, nencoding=None, edition=None, \
        appcontext=[], tag=None, matchanytag=None, shardingkey=[], \
        supershardingkey=[])
    Connection(user=None, password=None, dsn=None, \
        mode=cx_Oracle.DEFAULT_AUTH, handle=0, pool=None, threaded=False, \
        events=False, cclass=None, purity=cx_Oracle.ATTR_PURITY_DEFAULT, \
        newpassword=None, encoding=None, nencoding=None, edition=None, \
        appcontext=[], tag=None, matchanytag=False, shardingkey=[], \
        supershardingkey=[])

    Constructor for creating a connection to the database. Return a
    :ref:`connection object <connobj>`. All parameters are optional and can be
    specified as keyword parameters.  See :ref:`connhandling` information about
    connections.

    The dsn (data source name) is the TNS entry (from the Oracle names server
    or tnsnames.ora file) or is a string like the one returned from
    :meth:`~cx_Oracle.makedsn()`. If the user parameter is passed and the
    password and dsn parameters are not passed, the user parameter is assumed
    to be a connect string in the format ``user/password@dsn``, the same format
    accepted by Oracle applications such as SQL\*Plus.  See :ref:`connstr` for
    more information.

    If the mode is specified, it must be one of the
    :ref:`connection authorization modes<connection-authorization-modes>`
    which are defined at the module level.

    If the handle is specified, it must be of type OCISvcCtx\* and is only of
    use when embedding Python in an application (like PowerBuilder) which has
    already made the connection. The connection thus created should *never* be
    used after the source handle has been closed or destroyed.

    The pool parameter is expected to be a
    :ref:`session pool object <sesspool>` and the use of this parameter is the
    equivalent of calling :meth:`SessionPool.acquire()`. Parameters not
    accepted by that method are ignored.

    The threaded parameter is expected to be a boolean expression which
    indicates whether or not Oracle should wrap accesses to connections with a
    mutex. Doing so in single threaded applications imposes a performance
    penalty of about 10-15% which is why the default is False.

    The events parameter is expected to be a boolean expression which indicates
    whether or not to initialize Oracle in events mode. This is required for
    continuous query notification and high availability event notifications.

    The cclass parameter is expected to be a string and defines the connection
    class for database resident connection pooling (DRCP).

    The purity parameter is expected to be one of
    :data:`~cx_Oracle.ATTR_PURITY_NEW`, :data:`~cx_Oracle.ATTR_PURITY_SELF`, or
    :data:`~cx_Oracle.ATTR_PURITY_DEFAULT`.

    The newpassword parameter is expected to be a string if specified and sets
    the password for the logon during the connection process.

    See the :ref:`globalization <globalization>` section for details on the
    encoding and nencoding parameters.  Note the default encoding and nencoding
    values changed to "UTF-8" in cx_Oracle 8, and any character set in NLS_LANG
    is ignored.

    The edition parameter is expected to be a string if specified and sets the
    edition to use for the session. It is only relevant if both the client and
    the database are at least Oracle Database 11.2. If this parameter is used
    with the cclass parameter the exception "DPI-1058: edition not supported
    with connection class" will be raised.

    The appcontext parameter is expected to be a list of 3-tuples, if specified,
    and sets the application context for the connection. Application context
    is available in the database by using the sys_context() PL/SQL method and
    can be used within a logon trigger as well as any other PL/SQL procedures.
    Each entry in the list is expected to contain three strings: the namespace,
    the name and the value.

    The tag parameter, if specified, is expected to be a string and will limit
    the sessions that can be returned from a session pool unless the
    matchanytag parameter is set to True. In that case sessions with the
    specified tag will be preferred over others, but if no such sessions are
    available a session with a different tag may be returned instead. In any
    case, untagged sessions will always be returned if no sessions with the
    specified tag are available. Sessions are tagged when they are
    :meth:`released <SessionPool.release>` back to the pool.

    The shardingkey and supershardingkey parameters, if specified, are expected
    to be a sequence of values which will be used to identify the database
    shard to connect to. The key values can be strings, numbers, bytes or dates.


.. function:: Cursor(connection)

    Constructor for creating a cursor.  Return a new
    :ref:`cursor object <cursorobj>` using the connection.

    .. note::

        This method is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. function:: Date(year, month, day)

    Construct an object holding a date value.


.. function:: DateFromTicks(ticks)

    Construct an object holding a date value from the given ticks value (number
    of seconds since the epoch; see the documentation of the standard Python
    time module for details).


.. function:: init_oracle_client(lib_dir=None, config_dir=None, \
        error_url=None, driver_name=None)

    Initialize the Oracle client library now, rather than when
    :func:`cx_Oracle.clientversion()`, :func:`cx_Oracle.connect()` or
    :func:`cx_Oracle.SessionPool()` is called for the first time. If
    initialization has already taken place, an exception is raised.

    If the parameter `lib_dir` is not `None` or the empty string,
    the specified directory is the only one searched for the Oracle Client
    libraries; otherwise, the standard way of locating the Oracle Client
    library is used.

    If the parameter `config_dir` is not `None` or the empty string, the
    specified directory is used to find Oracle Client library configuration
    files. This is equivalent to setting the environment variable `TNS_ADMIN`
    and overrides any value already set in `TNS_ADMIN`. If this parameter is not
    set, the standard way of locating Oracle Client library configuration files
    is used.

    If the parameter `error_url` is not `None` or the empty string, the
    specified value is included in the message of the exception raised when the
    Oracle Client library cannot be loaded; otherwise, the :ref:`installation`
    URL is included.

    If the parameter `driver_name` is not `None` or the empty string, the
    specified value can be found in database views that give information about
    connections. For example, it is in the ``CLIENT_DRIVER`` column of
    ``V$SESSION_CONNECT_INFO``. The standard is to set this value to
    ``"<name> : version>"``, where <name> is the name of the driver and
    <version> is its version. There should be a single space character before
    and after the colon. If this value is not specified, then the default
    value of "cx_Oracle : <version>" is used.

    See :ref:`initialization` for more discussion.

    .. note::

        This method is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. function:: makedsn(host, port, sid=None, service_name=None, region=None, \
        sharding_key=None, super_sharding_key=None)

    Return a string suitable for use as the dsn parameter for
    :meth:`~cx_Oracle.connect()`. This string is identical to the strings that
    are defined by the Oracle names server or defined in the tnsnames.ora file.

    .. note::

        This method is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. function:: SessionPool(user=None, password=None, dsn=None, min=1, max=2, \
        increment=1, connectiontype=cx_Oracle.Connection, threaded=False, \
        getmode=cx_Oracle.SPOOL_ATTRVAL_NOWAIT, events=False, \
        homogeneous=True, externalauth=False, encoding=None, nencoding=None, \
        edition=None, timeout=0, waitTimeout=0, maxLifetimeSession=0, \
        sessionCallback=None, maxSessionsPerShard=0)

    Create and return a :ref:`session pool object <sesspool>`.  Session pooling
    (also known as connection pooling) creates a pool of available connections
    to the database, allowing applications to acquire a connection very quickly.
    It is of primary use in a server where connections are requested in rapid
    succession and used for a short period of time, for example in a web server.
    See :ref:`connpool` for more information.

    Connection pooling in cx_Oracle is handled by Oracle's
    `Session pooling <https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?
    ctx=dblatest&id=GUID-F9662FFB-EAEF-495C-96FC-49C6D1D9625C>`__
    technology.  This allows cx_Oracle applications to support features
    like `Application Continuity <https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?
    ctx=dblatest&id=GUID-A8DD9422-2F82-42A9-9555-134296416E8F>`__.

    The user, password and dsn parameters are the same as for
    :meth:`cx_Oracle.connect()`

    The min, max and increment parameters control pool growth behavior.  A fixed
    pool size where min equals max is recommended to help prevent connection
    storms and to help overall system stability.  The min parameter is the
    number of connections opened when the pool is created.  The increment is the
    number of connections that are opened whenever a connection request exceeds
    the number of currently open connections.  The max parameter is the maximum
    number of connections that can be open in the connection pool.

    Note that when using :ref:`external authentication <extauth>`,
    :ref:`heterogeneous pools <connpooltypes>`, or :ref:`drcp`, then the pool
    growth behavior is different.  In these cases the number of connections
    created at pool startup is always zero, and the increment is always one.

    If the connectiontype parameter is specified, all calls to
    :meth:`~SessionPool.acquire()` will create connection objects of that type,
    rather than the base type defined at the module level.

    The threaded parameter is expected to be a boolean expression which
    indicates whether Oracle should wrap accesses to connections with a mutex.
    Doing so in single threaded applications imposes a performance penalty of
    about 10-15% which is why the default is False.

    The getmode parameter indicates whether or not future
    :func:`SessionPool.acquire()` calls will wait for available connections.  It
    can be one of the :ref:`Session Pool Get Modes <sesspoolmodes>` values.

    The events parameter is expected to be a boolean expression which indicates
    whether or not to initialize Oracle in events mode. This is required for
    continuous query notification and high availability event notifications.

    The homogeneous parameter is expected to be a boolean expression which
    indicates whether or not to create a homogeneous pool. A homogeneous pool
    requires that all connections in the pool use the same credentials. As such
    proxy authentication and external authentication is not possible with a
    homogeneous pool.  See :ref:`Heterogeneous and Homogeneous Connection Pools
    <connpooltypes>`.

    The externalauth parameter is expected to be a boolean expression which
    indicates whether or not external authentication should be used. External
    authentication implies that something other than the database is
    authenticating the user to the database. This includes the use of operating
    system authentication and Oracle wallets.  See :ref:`Connecting Using
    External Authentication <extauth>`.

    The encoding and nencoding parameters set the encodings used for string
    values transferred between cx_Oracle and Oracle Database, see
    :ref:`Character Sets and Globalization <globalization>`. Note the default
    encoding and nencoding values changed to "UTF-8" in cx_Oracle 8, and any
    character set in NLS_LANG is ignored.

    The edition parameter is expected to be a string, if specified, and sets the
    edition to use for the sessions in the pool. It is only relevant if both the
    client and the server are at least Oracle Database 11.2.  See
    :ref:`Edition-Based Redefinition (EBR) <ebr>`.

    The timeout parameter is expected to be an integer, if specified, and sets
    the length of time (in seconds) after which idle sessions in the pool are
    terminated. Note that termination only occurs when the pool is accessed.
    The default value of 0 means that no idle sessions are terminated.

    The waitTimeout parameter is expected to be an integer, if specified, and
    sets the length of time (in milliseconds) that the caller should wait for
    a session to become available in the pool before returning with an error.
    This value is only used if the getmode parameter is set to the value
    :data:`cx_Oracle.SPOOL_ATTRVAL_TIMEDWAIT`.

    The maxLifetimeSession parameter is expected to be an integer, if
    specified, and sets the maximum length of time (in seconds) a pooled
    session may exist. Sessions that are in use will not be closed. They become
    candidates for termination only when they are released back to the pool and
    have existed for longer than maxLifetimeSession seconds. Note that
    termination only occurs when the pool is accessed. The default value is 0
    which means that there is no maximum length of time that a pooled session
    may exist.

    The sessionCallback parameter is expected to be either a string or a
    callable. If the sessionCallback parameter is a callable, it will be called
    when a newly created connection is returned from the pool, or when a tag is
    requested and that tag does not match the connection's actual tag. The
    callable will be invoked with the connection and the requested tag as its
    only parameters.  If the parameter is a string, it should be the name of a
    PL/SQL procedure that will be called when :func:`SessionPool.acquire()`
    requests a tag and that tag does not match the connection's actual tag. See
    :ref:`Session CallBacks for Setting Pooled Connection State
    <sessioncallback>`. Support for the PL/SQL procedure requires Oracle Client
    libraries 12.2 or later.  See the `OCI documentation
    <https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=dblatest&
    id=GUID-B853A020-752F-494A-8D88-D0396EF57177>`__ for more information.

    The maxSessionsPerShard parameter is expected to be an integer, if
    specified, and sets the maximum number of sessions in the pool that can be
    used for any given shard in a sharded database. This value is ignored if
    the Oracle client library version is less than 18.3.

    .. note::

        This method is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. function:: Time(hour, minute, second)

    Construct an object holding a time value.

    .. note::

        The time only data type is not supported by Oracle. Calling this
        function will raise a NotSupportedError exception.



.. function:: TimeFromTicks(ticks)

    Construct an object holding a time value from the given ticks value (number
    of seconds since the epoch; see the documentation of the standard Python
    time module for details).

    .. note::

        The time only data type is not supported by Oracle. Calling this
        function will raise a NotSupportedError exception.


.. function:: Timestamp(year, month, day, hour, minute, second)

    Construct an object holding a time stamp value.


.. function:: TimestampFromTicks(ticks)

    Construct an object holding a time stamp value from the given ticks value
    (number of seconds since the epoch; see the documentation of the standard
    Python time module for details).



.. _constants:

Constants
=========

General
-------

.. data:: apilevel

    String constant stating the supported DB API level. Currently '2.0'.


.. data:: buildtime

    String constant stating the time when the binary was built.

    .. note::

        This constant is an extension to the DB API definition.


.. data:: paramstyle

    String constant stating the type of parameter marker formatting expected by
    the interface. Currently 'named' as in 'where name = :name'.


.. data:: threadsafety

    Integer constant stating the level of thread safety that the interface
    supports.  Currently 2, which means that threads may share the module and
    connections, but not cursors. Sharing means that a thread may use a
    resource without wrapping it using a mutex semaphore to implement resource
    locking.

    Note that in order to make use of multiple threads in a program which
    intends to connect and disconnect in different threads, the threaded
    parameter to :meth:`connect()` or :meth:`SessionPool()` must be true.


.. data:: version
.. data:: __version__

    String constant stating the version of the module. Currently '|release|'.

    .. note::

        This attribute is an extension to the DB API definition.

.. data:: DEQ_NEXT_MSG

    This constant is used to specify that dequeue should retrieve the next
    available message that matches the search criteria. If the previous message
    belongs to a message group, AQ retrieves the next available message that
    matches the search criteria and belongs to the message group. This is the
    default.

constants used in advanced queuing.


.. data:: MSG_NO_DELAY

    This constant is a possible value for the :attr:`~MessageProperties.delay`
    attribute of the :ref:`message properties object <msgproperties>` passed
    as the msgproperties parameter to the :meth:`Connection.deq()` and

-----------------------

These constants are extensions to the DB API definition. They are possible
values for the mode parameter of the :meth:`Connection.shutdown()` method.


.. data:: DBSHUTDOWN_ABORT

    This constant is used to specify that the caller should not wait for
    current processing to complete or for users to disconnect from the
    database. This should only be used in unusual circumstances since database
    recovery may be necessary upon next startup.


.. data:: DBSHUTDOWN_FINAL

    This constant is used to specify that the instance can be truly halted.
    This should only be done after the database has been shutdown with one of
    the other modes (except abort) and the database has been closed and
    dismounted using the appropriate SQL commands.

.. data:: EVENT_AQ

    This constant is used to specify that one or more messages are available
    for dequeuing on the queue specified when the subscription was created.


.. data:: EVENT_DEREG

    This constant is used to specify that the subscription has been
    deregistered and no further notifications will be sent.


.. data:: EVENT_NONE

    This constant is used to specify no information is available about the
    event.


.. data:: EVENT_OBJCHANGE

    This constant is used to specify that a database change has taken place on
    a table registered with the :meth:`Subscription.registerquery()` method.


.. data:: EVENT_QUERYCHANGE

    This constant is used to specify that the result set of a query registered
    with the :meth:`Subscription.registerquery()` method has been changed.


.. data:: EVENT_SHUTDOWN

.. _exceptions:

Exceptions
==========

.. exception:: Warning

    Exception raised for important warnings and defined by the DB API but not
    actually used by cx_Oracle.


.. exception:: Error

    Exception that is the base class of all other exceptions defined by
    cx_Oracle and is a subclass of the Python StandardError exception (defined
    in the module exceptions).


.. exception:: InterfaceError

    Exception raised for errors that are related to the database interface
    rather than the database itself. It is a subclass of Error.


.. exception:: DatabaseError

    Exception raised for errors that are related to the database. It is a
    subclass of Error.


.. exception:: DataError

    Exception raised for errors that are due to problems with the processed
    data. It is a subclass of DatabaseError.


.. exception:: OperationalError

    Exception raised for errors that are related to the operation of the
    database but are not necessarily under the control of the programmer. It is
    a subclass of DatabaseError.


.. exception:: IntegrityError

    Exception raised when the relational integrity of the database is affected.
    It is a subclass of DatabaseError.


.. exception:: InternalError

    Exception raised when the database encounters an internal error. It is a
    subclass of DatabaseError.

    Exception raised when a method or database API was used which is not
    supported by the database. It is a subclass of DatabaseError.


.. _exchandling:

Exception handling
==================

.. note::

    PEP 249 (Python Database API Specification v2.0) says the following about
    exception values:

        [...] The values of these exceptions are not defined. They should
        give the user a fairly good idea of what went wrong, though. [...]

    With cx_Oracle every exception object has exactly one argument in the
    ``args`` tuple. This argument is a ``cx_Oracle._Error`` object which has
    the following five read-only attributes.

.. attribute:: _Error.code

    Integer attribute representing the Oracle error number (ORA-XXXXX).

.. attribute:: _Error.offset

    Integer attribute representing the error offset when applicable.

.. attribute:: _Error.message

    String attribute representing the Oracle message of the error. This
    message is localized by the environment of the Oracle connection.

.. attribute:: _Error.context

    String attribute representing the context in which the exception was
    raised.

.. attribute:: _Error.isrecoverable

    Boolean attribute representing whether the error is recoverable or not.
    This is False in all cases unless both Oracle Database 12.1 (or later) and
    Oracle Client 12.1 (or later) are being used.

    .. versionadded:: 5.3


This allows you to use the exceptions for example in the following way:

::

    import cx_Oracle

    connection = cx_Oracle.connect("cx_Oracle/dev@localhost/orclpdb1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()

    try:
        cursor.execute("select 1 / 0 from dual")
    except cx_Oracle.DatabaseError as exc:
        error, = exc.args
        print("Oracle-Error-Code:", error.code)
        print("Oracle-Error-Message:", error.message)
